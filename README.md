## React Boilerplate with custom inputs and date I/O handling

This project is intended to be used as a standard react application boilerplate without requiring to make the input controls as components with proper validation and data I/O capability, http requests with error handling, and other regular stuffs. These works are still work in progress. Any contributions and suggestions are welcome.

## Currently functional features (as of 28th Aug 2019):
- Basic Routing (react-router)
- Custom input components without any styling and still incapable of data manipulation
